# Mac-Map
Navigating College can be challenging! During the first weeks of their college experience, lots of students struggle to locate their classes because they are new to campus, but it can also be challenging for current students if they are unfamiliar with a building where they have not taken classes before. At Mac, it can be especially challenging to find classes based on the numeric code that's displayed on students' schedules.

MacMap is an interactive wubsite designed to help students find their classes based on the room codes they receive when enrolling.
